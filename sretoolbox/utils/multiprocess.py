    """
    Applies the provided function `func` to each element in the given
    `iterable` using a process pool with a maximum of `process_pool_size`.

    Args:
        func (callable): A function to be applied to the elements of the
            iterable. This function should take one positional argument and
            return a result.
        iterable (iterable): An iterable object containing the input elements
            to be processed by the `func` function.
        process_pool_size (int): An integer that specifies the maximum number
            of workers to be used for processing the iterable.
        return_exceptions (bool, optional): A boolean value indicating whether
            exceptions raised by the `func` function should be returned in the
            result list or not. Default is `False`.
        **kwargs: Optional keyword arguments that will be passed to the `func`
            function along with the input elements.

    Returns:
        list: A list of results after applying the `func` function to each
        element of the iterable.

    Raises:
        The function raises any exceptions raised by the `func` function, with
        full traceback information, if `return_exceptions` is `False`.

    Notes:
        - If `return_exceptions` is `True`, any exceptions raised by the `func`
          function are returned in the result list.
        - Otherwise this function catches `SystemExit` exceptions and
          propagates a `SystemExitWrapper` exception.

    Example:
        >>> def square(x):
        ...     return x ** 2
        >>> iterable = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        >>> pool_size = 2
        >>> run(square, iterable, pool_size)
        [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
