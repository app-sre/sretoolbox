    This decorator will retry a function for several attempts if it raises an
    expected exception. Additionally it supports running a hook each time there
    is a new attempt.

        defaults to Exception

    :param max_attempts: number of max attemps before giving up and raising
        the exception, defaults to 3
    :type max_attempts: int, optional
    :param no_retry_exceptions: exceptions to be excluded from the retry,
        defaults to ()
    :type no_retry_exceptions: tuple, optional
    :param hook: function which will be triggered each time there is a retry
        attempt, defaults to None
