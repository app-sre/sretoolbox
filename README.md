SRE Toolbox
===========

Set of libraries commonly used by multiple SRE projects:

- ``container.Image``: class for container image inspection.
- ``container.Skopeo``: wrapper around
  `Skopeo <https://github.com/containers/skopeo>`_.
- ``utils.replace_values``: deep replace of object values according to values map.
- ``utils.retry``: decorator to add resilience to function calls.
